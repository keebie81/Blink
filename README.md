# Blink

This is a Windows10 app that I created. It works with the Arduino MKR1000. It will allow you to turn the LED at pin 6 on and off. This app connects to the Arduino via WiFi. You will need to change the ip adress in the MainPage.xaml.cs tab to match yours.

I also did a YouTube video about this app - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNuMiAoVAlw
